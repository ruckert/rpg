## Introduction

Following the same proposal of Mage 5e Homebrew written by EnterElysium and Yogarpg, this version also intends to update the system to the game mechanics found on V5, H5, and W5 while keeping the premises from M20. Also, adjust or propose ways for some elements that, even in the original game, could have been clearer about using in-game or have complicated/not integrated rules or rulings.

The proposed changes have three main objectives: 1) Simplify the game, making it more straightforward how to use the elements of Mage, mechanically or dynamically; 2) Bring the game closer to a personal horror atmosphere, giving more weight to the decisions and consequences of having powers; 3) Guide new players more in creating characters and starting more quickly in the Mage universe.

## Concepts

### What are mages?

Mages are humans able to modify the threads of the reality tapestry, exerting their will to alter what's real and possible. They can do it because some part of them changed, awakening, by trauma, chance, revelation, training, or something else. This awakened fragment is called Avatar, part of the mage, and something by itself. The power of a Mage is limited by the level of comprehension/illumination, called Arete, by their knowledge and beliefs, and by the weight of the reality consensus.

> **Note on mages vs. other World of Darkness creatures - for WoD fans.**
>
> Mages are not vampires or werewolves - they are not immortal creatures tormented by their purpose or condition, seeking to control their inner beast and maintain their humanity. Mages are humans who, for some reason beyond their control or understanding, can manipulate the fabric of reality. The mage's struggle is about harmony and change (of themselves and the world), not about suppression/control of their dark side.

### What's the game about

**Mage is a game about having the power to alter reality and the consequences of your actions and condition**. Performing magick is an act of will against the fabric of consensual reality, an attempt to sew the world in your way. The actions of each mage are potent and dangerous, both for themselves and for others.

The world where Mage takes place is a darker copy of our world, where the supernatural is real and lurks in the shadows. It is also where we have reached cultural, social, economic, and historical points very similar to those of our world, but with partially hidden or forgotten involvement of the supernatural. It's a breeding ground for conspiracy theories, extreme hypotheses, and improbable conjectures.

Reality is a matter for discussion, manipulation, and alteration, and therefore, always open to inconsistency in a tremendous and eternal Rashomon effect. And mages are the beings best equipped for this scenario.

### Lexicon

- **Arete/Enlightenment**: Level of comprehension/illumination about change the reality tapestry.
- **Avatar**: The fragment of the mage (soul, mind, spirit, depending on mage's beliefs) that waked. Some mages experience as another self. (a.k.a. Genius, for Technocracy).
- **Awakened**: Humans who now understand how to change reality at their will.
- **Essence**: Describe the Avatar's universal affinity (Metaphysical Trinity), manifestation pattern, and how its reality alteration tends to reverberate (called Resonance). It is connected with the mage's awakening event and usually, but not always, connects with the mage's expression, desires, and ways of living (a.k.a. Eidolon, for Technocracy).
- **Paradox**: Paradox is the reaction of reality to the attempt to alter it; it materializes in many forms, from damage (called Burn), strange alterations, and effects — temporary and permanent, to a mage's imprisonment in alternative realities (Paradox reigns).
- **Consensual reality**: ??
- **Quintessence**: ??
- **Quiet**: A magical delusion that distorts mages' perception of reality. It's a form of isolation from shared reality, where mages become trapped in their mental world — one of the consequences of Paradox.
- **Corruption or Fall:** Corruption or Fall is the process of dehumanization that the magick practitioner undergoes from having such power at their disposal. It is increased by what they do or suffer—pride, temptation, despair, greed, indiscipline, killing.
- **Sleepers**: Sleepers are all mortals who cannot change reality by their own will. However, they subconsciously influence and possibly even sustain our reality with the shared Consensus.
- **Metaphysical Trinity**: ??

## Stats

### General stats

For the character definition, we'll follow the same basic stats of the Storyteller system presented on H5, V5, and W5: Attributes, Skill, Health track, and Willpower track.

_By default, unless quoted, **Hunter 5th edition is the reference ruleset** for the general Storyteller system to avoid duplication of terms and definitions._

### Specific stats

- **Arete level**: how the mage can impose their will to change the reality fabric. The Arete limits the maximum level of the Spheres.
- **Paradox track**: how much paradox mage has accumulated at the moment. The volume of Paradox limits the quantity of the total maximum Quintessence*.*  a mage can hold (one less maximum per paradox point). The Paradox is generated due to some magickal effects, and it backlashes or discharges depending on the effect results. It ranges from 0 to 10.
- **Quintessence track**: The Quintessence quantity **currently held in a mage's Avatar. Its maximum value equals the Arete level but can be increased through Prime effects, Node meditation, or wonder usage. The paradox track limits the maximum achievable: for each point of Paradox, the maximum quintessence decreases by one (e.g., paradox 1 = max quintessence 9, paradox 2 = max quintessence 8). It ranges from 0 to 10.
- **Resonance:** It's one word that represents how the mage's presence affects the surrounding world, even when not casting an effect, and how their magick resonates. It has to be connected with the Avatar's essence. For example, _Andrea is a mage, and her Avatar has a dynamic, with the Resonance defined as fidgety. Her presence alters the people's humor (depending on the level), making them more anxious and nervous._
- **Resonance level**: how much the mage resonance affects the reality when not casting an effect and how much their magick manifests and connects with some metaphysical. It ranges from 0 to 10, having the same value as the Arete or Quiet level, which is higher. After level five, the mage resonance generates a continuous chance of Paradox with a dice roll per scene and a dice pool equal to resonance level over five.
- **Quiet level**: Represents how well your character distinguishes between the real world and their ability to influence it. As this level increases, your character's Resonance rises too, and the characters become more unaware of the reality separated from themselves.
Used directly in dice pools as Hunger is in V5 or Rage is in W5, it also acts similarly to Humanity for long-term character viability. Like in V5, the dice roll can generate an Instability Failure (the equivalent of Bestial Failure) or a Shock Critical (the same as a Messy Critical). It ranges from 0 to 5. Once a Mage reaches 6 Quiet, they're an NPC.
- **Corruption level**: how far a mage is from the ascension path. As the power of the mage increases, what they do or suffer can push them away from the fragile path to Ascension. It acts similarly to V5 Humanity in terms of long-term character viability. It ranges from 0 to 10. Once a Mage reaches +10 of corruption, they're an NPC.
- **Spheres level**: the level of control the mage has over the aspects of reality. There are nine spheres with some variants: Correspondence (variant: Data), Forces, Prime (variant: Prime utility), Spirit (variant: Dimensional Science), Mind, Life, Matter, Time, and Entropy.

## Magick — Changing the reality

### Arete

It represents the ability a mage has to understand and modify reality.

- It defines the magick knowledge by limiting the maximum level of the Spheres;
- It defines the level of Resonance — if higher than the Quiet level;
- It defines the standard maximum of Quintessence a mage can hold and use to cast an effect;
- It defines how many Instruments a mage can use to cast spells: 2 + Arete, at seven at maximum.
- Your character must undergo a Seeking + spending the necessary experience points to raise your Arete. This vision quest forces him to face and overcome inner obstacles and grow in excellence and comprehension.

### Focus

Focus is the mage's medium for making magickal things. It's composed of three elements: the **paradigm**, or how the mage understands the world; the **practices**, or how the mage does magick; and the **instruments**, or what the mage uses in the practices to do the magick.

- **Paradigm**: The Paradigm defines how the mage understands the world. It can limit some Practices and define some Convictions.
  - You can define _Limited Practices_ based on the Prism of Focus.
- **Practices** are about how your mage does magick and what activities, rituals, and procedures they need to use. Perfecting the practice is essential to the Ascension but should be overcome as the Arete increases.
- **Instruments** are the tools, skills, and materials the mage need to execute their practices. A mage has 2 + Arete instruments (at seven maximum).

### Spell-casting

Spell-casting is a simplified way to explain the mages’ capacity to change reality. The level of enlightenment, practices, beliefs, and the force of the consensus limits it.

#### Premises for spell-casting

- Mages can attempt to generate effects at sphere levels they don't possess by facing more significant difficulties and requiring one quintessence point per sphere they don't have. The sphere system is a systematization of magical knowledge. It serves to inform learning and practice, not to restrict;
- Arete is the primary measure of enlightenment, but the practices and instruments limit how the magick can be made. The mage is freed from the limit of practices starting at six Arete;
- Roll all dice against difficulty six without variations. What is added is the need for more successes or the number of necessary successes is reduced, or available dice are added or reduced;
- Spheres with the same base but fundamentally different paradigms (e.g., Correspondence and Data) are more complex and will count as outside of practice (Arete = 0);

#### Steps to do Magick

1. **Proposal**: The player presents the spell casting.
    1. **Define what effect** you want your character to generate;
    2. **Define how they do it** — using the practice and instruments;
    3. **Propose a dice pool** — what the character has available to make it.
2. **Ruling**: The storyteller evaluates the proposal.
    1. **Define the dice pool adjustments** by the character stats and practice, and other tests and spending needed before or after the casting (skills, traits, checks, willpower, health, quintessence);
    2. **Define the effect conditions** (vulgar, coincidental, with witnesses, node presence, and so on) and possible impacts (paradox risk, scenario effects, chronicle effects);
    3. **Define the difficulty** accordingly to the effect proposed;
    4. **Negotiation**: The storyteller and Player negotiate the dice pool, tests, and difficulties.
3. **Result**: roll the dice!
    1. Effect and its results (or not);
    2. Consequences (or not).

#### Dice pool

For magick, the character rolls (dice pool):

- \+ Arete (max limited by the practice involved. Outside a practice, Arete = 0);
- \+ Number of sphere points involved for the effect the mage wants to generate;
- \+ One die per point of quintessence spent;
- \+ Successes in related skill; rolled before;
- +1 if the instrument is customized (+1 if unique, -1 if unfamiliar instrument);
- +1 if trained Route.

> **Use of quintessence and willpower**
>
> - The Willpower can be used for:
>   - A re-roll of one die per point spent. A mage can only spend one willpower point per turn for re-rolls. Quiet dice cannot be re-rolled;
>   - Enable the use of spheres in which the mage does not know, with one point spent per unknown sphere (level 0).
> - A mage can consume up to their Arete level of quintessence to add dice to the dice pool, with one point per die.

#### Difficulty of the casting

- \+ Magnitude: how many and how much some aspects of consensual reality are being altered;
- \+ Number of sphere points necessary for the effect;
- \+ Vulgar with witnesses, vulgar, coincidental (+2, +1, 0);
- \+ Mage's condition:
  - +1 if distracted;
  - Other condition.
- Environment:
  - \- Node (-3, -2, -1);
  - \- or + by the environment's Resonance;
  - \- or + Prevailing paradigm in the location.
- Amplifications: how much this effect will be amplified beyond the initial — extra successes beyond the minimum required can be distributed among these three factors by the player:
  - \+ range (standard: within the mage's perceptual field);
  - \+ duration (standard: up to one scene - one turn for damage);
  - \+ potency (standard: one damage die per competent sphere of the effect);
  - \+ targets (standard: one target per sphere level).
- Casting time
  - \-1 or +1 for reduction/increase of time level (session, scene, two turns, turn, half turn). _Based on the description, the player and the narrator negotiate the total casting time._

#### A simplified model for coincidental effects of up to two spheres of up to 3 points

For effects that require up to two spheres of up to three points, if the character has double or more dice in their dice pool than the difficulty and will perform coincidental magic, they can make the roll with just one die, failing only on a 1. If a one is rolled, roll once more, needing to roll a one again for a critical failure.

## The Fragile Path — Magick and its Consequences

Magick is the alteration of the fabric of reality - the Tapestry of Reality, which cannot be contained by mundane elements or those tied to Consensus. It results from the awakened's imposition of will upon the world. But there are three main consequences of altering reality:

1. _Paradox_ is the reaction of reality to the attempt to alter it;
2. _Quiet_ is the isolation from shared reality that mages can suffer, becoming trapped in their mental world, one of the results of Paradox
3. _Corruption or Fall_ is the process of dehumanization that the magick practitioner undergoes from having such power at their disposal.

The three effects impact the person who executed the magick and their surroundings, according to the potency of what was performed and the mage's immersion stage in reality. Walking on a knife's edge is called the _fragile path_ that every awakened person will inevitably tread.

> **Note on Paradox**
>
> Mages suffer Paradox for trying to alter the fabric of reality. Unlike creatures considered supernatural, who possess "magical" powers, Mages don't have powers; they change the fabric of reality so that reality is as they want it to be. They suffer paradoxes not because they navigate existing conditions but because they try to change the game's rules.

### Paradox

The Paradox occurs when the mage perceptively breaks with consensual reality. Reality fights back against the attempt to be changed.

| **Effect casting type and result**                                      | **Paradox dice pool**                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Successful coincidental effect or Failure in casting                    | 0                                              |
| Successful vulgar effect                                                | 2                                              |
| Successful vulgar effect w witnesses (sleepers, non-magickal believers) | 3                                              |
| Coincidental Effect + Instability Failure                               | Highest Sphere targeted (min 3)                |
| Vulgar Effect with Failure                                              | Highest Sphere targeted + 1 (min 4)            |
| Successful vulgar effect w witnesses + Instability Failure              | 2x Highest Sphere +2                           |
| Casting in a Sanctum/Laboratory                                         | +1 or –1 depends on your Sect/Practice/Essence |
| Other Modifiers                                                         | Reaching/Storyteller decides                   |

After the casting roll, roll the paradox check depending on the result. For each dice:

- 1-5: Paradox accumulation. The paradox track immediately increases by one.
- 6-9: Paradox backlash. The mage suffers a backlash effect; add one dice to the backlash pool and wait until all dice result to roll the pool; exceptions above.
- 10: Paradox discharge. The paradox track immediately decreases by one.

It immediately backlashes all your accumulated Paradox (pool size = accumulated paradox):

- When you roll a one at Quiet Dice when casting.
- When Paradox reaches 10.

#### Backlash roll

The storyteller rolls the backlash effect with the number of dice on the backlash poll:

| **Backlash pool successes** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Trivial Paradox Flaw |
| 2-3 | Burn + Trivial Paradox Flaw |
| 4-5 | Burn + Significant Paradox Flaw |
| 6-7 | Burn + One of permanent paradox + Severe Paradox Flaw |
| 8-9 | Burn + One of permanent paradox + Drastic Paradox Flaw |
| 10 | Banishment to a Paradox Realm |

- Burn is always superficial damage until five and aggravated after that
- The paradox flaw duration depends on the Quiet level at the moment:
  - Zero: One turn
  - One: One scene
  - Two: One Chapter/Day
  - Three: One Story/Month
  - Four: One Chronicle/Year
  - Five: Permanent

#### Backlash Mitigation

- Characters can take one point of Quiet to reduce the backlash level effect in two. This can only be chosen once per backlash;
- Characters can reduce that burn damage by two by taking one point of permanent Paradox. This can only be chosen once per backlash;
- Characters can delay the effect of the backlash until the end of the scene by spending willpower equal to the backlash pool's successes.

#### Losing Paradox

- Every day, if a mage does not use magick (other than sphere 1), they may roll one dice. For each success, they lose a point of Paradox;
- One day of meditation on a Node can cause a mage to lose the number of paradox levels equal to an Arete roll;
- Prime effects can remove Paradox.

### Quiet

Quiet represents the Mage becoming twisted and disassociated with the reality around them as Paradox warps their perception.

- It takes the place of the Hunger (V5) or the Rage (W5) in dice rolls: It goes from 0 to 5, which can only be reduced under the most exceptional of conditions, and replaces dice in any rolls, except the Willpower and Health checks;
- The Quiet type is related to the mage Essence, having different effects according to the essence: Madness for the Dynamic essence, Denial for the Pattern essence, Morbidity for the Primordial essence, or any one of the three for the Questing essence — generally related with the effect that generates the first Quiet level;
- It defines the level of Resonance — if higher than the Arete level;
- As the Quiet level goes up, additional knock-on effects emerge;
- Regardless of the type, once the Quiet hits six, the character becomes a Marauder, lost in their world and an NPC under the storyteller's control.

#### Gaining Quiet

- **Disassociation Roll**: Roll a dice pool equal to the unfilled dots of Paradox on the tracker (ten minus the paradox level). The minimum number of dice in a Disassociation Roll is one. If it results in no success, the character must gain 1 point of Quiet. In some cases, the Storyteller may ask the test outside casting situations.
- **Backlash Disassociation**: every time you roll zero successes in a Paradox Backlash, roll a Disassociation Roll.
- **Backlash Mitigation**: Characters can take one point of Quiet to reduce the backlash level effect in two. This can only be chosen once per backlash.
- **Desperation Power**: You can receive a +2 in Arete for one casting with a +1 Quiet as cost.

#### Losing Quiet

- **Sanity effort**: To reduce one level of Quiet, roll Composure or Resolve and take Willpower aggravated damage equal to the number of the chosen attribute. Necessary roleplay and the storyteller can define how much time it will take.
- **Magick**: Extended effect with Mind 4, Prime 4 effect + quintessence equal the Quiet level of the target, with the caster with a similar Focus of the target. Necessary roleplay and the storyteller can define how much time it will take.

#### Quiet Dice

- **Roll 1: Failure**, Instability Failure if the test fails; and Immediately Paradox Backlash;
- **Roll 2-5:** Failure;
- **Roll 6-9**: Success;
- **Roll 10**: Success, Shock Critical if the test succeeded.

_Quiet Dice can never be re-rolled using Willpower_.

##### Instability Failure

- **Madness (_Dynamic_)**: The character overreacts to one new stimulus they generated on the scene, which occupies their whole attention. For the remainder of the scene, they cannot interact with anything else unless they spend temporary Willpower points equal to the Quiet level or pass on a Willpower check with the number of successes equal or superior to the Quiet level.
- **Denial (_Static_)**: The character refuses to acknowledge something in the scene as existing. They treat the target for the remainder of the scene as if it doesn't exist. When directly confronted by the knowledge that the subject of their denial is real, they must spend temporary Willpower points equal to the Quiet level or pass on a Willpower check with the number of successes equal or superior to the Quiet level to acknowledge it.
- **Morbidity (_Entropic_)**: All characters' actions hurt people nearby. For the remainder of the scene, all succeeded rolls generate damage (physical or mental) unless they spend temporary Willpower points equal to the Quiet level or pass on a Willpower check with the number of successes equal or superior to the Quiet level.

##### Shock Critical

- **Madness (_Dynamic_)**: The character's success has a side effect by visibly and aggressively modifying something in the scene (the size varies accordingly with the number of successes on the Quiet roll: one success for small things, three for big, and so on). The player can negotiate what and how it changed. This change is considered a vulgar effect, and a paradox roll applies.
- **Denial (_Static_)**: The character's success comes with staying focused on the same procedure. The character must repeat the same action in a number of turns/times equal to the number of successes on the Quiet roll. They also become unresponsive to new stimuli and only process them once it's done. The mage cannot voluntarily spend willpower for the remainder of the scene.
- **Morbidity (_Entropic_)**: The character's success comes with a side effect, as the character's callousness comes to the fore. Attempting to knock out an enemy kills them; taking a driving shortcut hits pedestrians on the pavement; medicine involves an unwilling donor.

#### The Delusion Spiral

All the effects are accumulative.

- **Quiet 1: Subtle**. It generates subtle discomfort in unknown sleepers.
  - **Passive effect**: Minimal Resonance equals 1.
  - **Madness (_Dynamic_)**: Something subtle changes in the mage every day, such as the tone of the skin, the tone of the color of the eyes, or the details of the haircut.
  - **Denial (_Static_)**: The mage's appearance stays the same, even when the ambient (light, colors, sound, air) or weather changes.
  - **Morbidity (_Entropic_)**: The mage's appearance takes on a morbid air.
- **Quiet 2: Mild**. It generates minor discomfort for unknown sleepers.
  - **Passive effect**: Minimal Resonance equals 2.
  - **Madness (_Dynamic_)**: The character takes a penalty for all awareness, investigation, and insight rolls as you imagine clues that aren't there. However, you will receive a bonus on all craft and performance rolls. The amount equals half your Quiet rounded up.
  - **Denial (_Static_)**: You become entirely forgettable. Suitable for passing unnoticed but bad for making an impression. You suffer a negative penalty for social checks. Still, it is a bonus to pass through an unrecognized area or leave no trace against sleepers or mundane security (security tapes, mysterious fuzz, people's minds drawing a blank, etc.). The amount equals half your Quiet rounded up.
  - **Morbidity (_Entropic_)**: The character's morbid fascination and gaunt appearance startle those around. You get a negative penalty on all non-intimidation social checks but a bonus to all rolls related to corpses, ghosts, torture, or intimidation. The amount equals half your Quiet rounded up.
- **Quiet 3: Noticeable**. It generates a visible discomfort in unknown sleepers.
  - **Passive Effects**:
    - Minimal Resonance equals 3.
    - Roll 1 less dice for backlash (to a minimum of 1).
- **Quiet 4: Strong**. Unknown sleepers feel very uncomfortable close to you, and close sleepers seem to feel strange with you.
  - **Passive Effects**:
    - Roll 1 additional dice for spell-casting.
    - Minimal Resonance equals 4.
    - Roll 2 less dice for backlash (to a minimum of 1).
  - **Madness (_Dynamic_)**: The character's Instability Failure can manifest in every scene, with a chance equal to the quiet level in a d10. The hallucination becomes real for the scene as if cast by a spell at a magnitude roughly equal to the character's Arete.
  - **Denial (_Static_)**: The character's Instability Failure can manifest in every scene, with a chance equal to Quiet level in a d10. The subject of their denial is somehow eliminated from the scene as if cast by a spell at a magnitude roughly equal to the character's Arete.
  - **Morbidity (_Entropic_)**: The effect of the character's Instability Failure can manifest in every scene, with a chance equal to Quiet level in a d10. The destruction is wider-ranging and more deliberately callous, leaving Jhor taint behind.
- **Quiet 5: Overwhelming**. All sleepers suffer in your presence.
  - **Passive Effect**:
    - Roll 3 less dice for backlash (to a minimum of 1).
    - Minimal Resonance equals 5.
  - **Madness (_Dynamic_)**: The character can no longer use Quintessence gained outside a long-term known node. They permanently lose 1 point from their willpower tracker.
  - **Denial (_Static_)**: The character can no longer use Quintessence gained outside a long-term known node. They permanently lose 1 point from their willpower tracker.
  - **Morbidity (_Entropic_)**: The character can no longer use Quintessence gained without sacrificing a living being. They permanently lose 1 point from their health tracker.
- **Quiet 6+**
  - **Passive Effect**: Marauder. No longer a player character.

### Resonance

Resonance is a side effect of the mage's enlightenment or quiet. As the power goes up, the mage becomes a continuous reality-changing element.

- The Resonance is associated with the mage's essence, and it can be expressed by one word (be creative);
- The value of the resonance level is equal to Arete or Quiet (the higher);
- Mages cannot control the Resonance but can hide it temporarily with magickal effects.

#### Resonance levels

- **Resonance 1**: Some small things resonate with your actions, intensified by your Resonance.
- **Resonance 2**: Some small things resonate with your actions, being modified by your Resonance.
- **Resonance 3**: You gain Echoes 1 related to your Resonance or increase your existing Echoes by 1, as patterns tend to shift around you.
- **Resonance 4**: You gain Echoes 2 related to your Resonance or increase your existing Echoes by 1, as patterns tend to shift around you.
- **Resonance 5**: You gain Echoes 3 related to your Resonance or increase your existing Echoes by 1, as patterns tend to shift around you.

### Corruption

On the path to Ascension, the mage can deviate (by chance, will, or external pushes) to other paths leading to the Fall. During the living, some things can conduct the mage in this way:

- **Pride**: with the reality in their hands, the mages become indifferent to others and the world. They feel like gods, full of hubris.
- **Temptation**: the path of the falling promises more power. Some mages choose this way.
- **Despair**: a mage that suffers at the hand of another and can also fall. It's the effect of the avatar suffering and the resulting rage, fear, and hate.
- **Greed**: By being too attached to the materialistic reality, a mage can forget the path to Ascension.
- **Indiscipline**: If a mage is not evolving their art, they will banalize their power usage.
- **Killing**: eliminating a living being and, with time, feeling indifferent to their suffering is the fastest track to the fall.

#### Generating corruption

By the end of the session, the characters must make a _Judgement test_ with a dice pool composed of (only one category per situation, with the higher value counting). With the dice pool, each success generates one point of corruption. The character can use willpower to re-roll.

| Act                                  | Dice pool                  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Killing a human needlessly           | +3                         |
| Destroying an Avatar                 | +4                         |

### Merits

- **Acute Senses**
  - ● or ●●● **Acute Senses**: Your physical senses are exceptionally keen, allowing you to notice details that most people overlook. In game terms, your character reduces the difficulty of Insight, Awareness, and Investigation rolls by -1 (1 point) or -2 (3 points).
- **Avatar Capacity**
  - ●● **Capacious Avatar**: Your Avatar is unusually good at holding Quintessence. Your capacity for holding Quintessence is equal to one more than normal.
  - ●●●● **Mighty Avatar**: Your Avatar is especially good at holding Quintessence. Your capacity for holding Quintessence is equal to two more than normal.
  - _Flaw_: (●●) **Limited Avatar**: Your Avatar is poor at holding Quintessence. Your capacity for holding Quintessence is equal to one less than normal.
- **Avatar/Genius Strength**
  - ●●●●● **Brutal Avatar**: You gain +1 to your Arete for all rolls. All rolls to counterspell your magic gain two dice, provided they can counter-spell.
  - _Flaw_: (●●●) **Subtle Avatar**: You lose –1 Arete for all rolls. However, with rolls to counterspell, you always lose one dice.
- **Bard’s Tongue**
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Bard’s Tongue**: Things you say sometimes become true in unfortunate ways. The Storyteller should use this to hamper your character with an ill fortune but not necessarily directly imperil you.
- **Beast Affinity:** Animals are unusually drawn to you; although you can’t speak to them, you can communicate on a limited level based on body language and tone.
  - ● **Beast Affinity**: One specific type of animal is affected (i.e., Crows).
  - ●● **Beast Kinship**: One specific group of animals is affected (i.e., Birds).
  - ●●● **Beast Mastery**: All natural animals are affected.
  - ●●●●● **Unnatural Beast Mastery**: Even supernatural animals are affected by your aura, although it only covers non-sapient creatures.
- **Combat Tools**
  - ●●  **Combat Tool**: Your character has studied extensively in Akashayana Do, magickal swords, hyper tech guns, ecstatic dance, or another skill that can be used as a magickal tool. This allows her to use combat techniques as Tools for instant spells. When taking this Merit, choose a Skill in which your character must have three or more dots. This merit allows for using that skill in combat as an instrument, adding dice to a spell cast on subsequent turns or to a spell cast reflexively in the same turn as the combat action. You may purchase this Merit multiple times to reflect the other styles.
- **Curiosity**
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Curiosity**: Your curiosity overrides your commonsense. Resisting temptation requires a successful Wits + Resolve (2) check.
- **Cursed**
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Slight Curse**: Tech fails around you, traffic jams occur whenever you drive, and tires go flat.
  - _Flaw_: (●●) **Moderate Curse**: Your car breaks down when you need it, your expensive clothes end up stained, and tools break when you use them.
  - _Flaw_: (●●●) **Severe Curse**: Accidents frequently happen to you, your bank account and internet accounts are commonly hacked, you keep getting your wallet and phone stolen, and driving anywhere is a risk.
- **Echoes:** Typically, this will be associated with your Affinity Sphere or Resonance.
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Slight Echoes**: Animals shy away from you, milk sours in your presence, a strange smell appropriate to your nature follows and proceeds you or similar. Sensitive people might get odd feelings around you.
  - _Flaw_: (●●) **Noticeable Echoes**: People who know what to look for recognize you on sight. Flowers bloom or wither in your presence, or music echoes through the air. Holy or unholy symbols repulse you and might force you to make a willpower check.
  - _Flaw_: (●●●) **Major Echoes**: Even sleepers notice how you stand out. Your shadow moves of its own accord. You don’t cast reflections, cold winds follow you, or people feel nauseous in your presence. People who know folklore might know the precautions to take (Intelligence + Occult may be used to counterspell against you, Resolve + Occult vs your Willpower may be used to keep you at bay physically).
- **Enemy**
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Bound** (To be taken with an enemy): Your enemy is bound to you somehow and will always turn up or interfere at the worst time.
- **Faith**
  - ●●●●● **True Faith**: You have a burning faith in something divine. This faith protects and fills you. You start with one dot of True Faith, which can be increased with experience points. You gain some advantages:
    - When attacking anything deemed truly evil or tainted, the number of your damage points equal to your True Faith may not be reduced by armor or innate abilities belonging to the creature in any way;
    - You have additional points of armor that count against direct mystic attacks, torture, or other thematic sources of damage equal to your True Faith;
    - True Faith may be spent for the same benefits as a point of willpower;
    - True Faith can be spent to act as though you had the Life Sphere (equal to your current True Faith value) for the benevolent healing of good creatures.
  - However, True Faith also demands rigorous adherence to a very inflexible moral code, and those who act against people not covered by their code or who act outside of the code find their True Faith abilities temporarily or permanently disappear.
- **Folklore Bane**
  - _Flaw_: (●●●) **Fire**: Fire burns you more than most. When using mystical methods to avoid, reduce, or otherwise diminish flames, you roll 1 less dice, and all flame-based attacks deal 1 extra point of aggravated damage against you.
  - _Flaw_: (● to ●●●) **Threshold**: When crossing into private property where someone lives, you lose between 1 and 3 Arete while there (corresponding to the number of dots in the flaw) unless explicitly invited by someone who lives there.
  - _Flaw_: (●●) **Running Water**: Standing over bodies of water causes your magic to seep away in proportion to the volume and speed at which it flows. In game terms, you take a penalty to your Arete: around one for a small stream, heavy rain, or sewers; two for a small sedate river, torrential rain, or deep lake; four for a major rushing river or deep ocean; and five for Niagara Falls. If this penalty reduces your Arete to 0 or below you may not cast and any ongoing spells you are maintaining end.
  - _Flaw_: (●●) **Sleeper Bane**: Mundane humans are your downfall. Sleepers count as having rolled one success more with any successful attack against you, and your mystical methods of reducing the damage reduce it by one less.
- **_aunt_d**
  - _Flaw_: (●●●) **Haunted**: A wraith plagues you for some reason and makes your life hell. It can possess you or people you know, slam doors, twist your dreams, and throw things around.
- **Health**
  - ●●● **True Grit**: You refuse to go down in a fight that extends beyond the limits of ordinary human bodies. You may take a point of aggravated willpower damage to temporarily gain three health boxes that disappear at the end of the scene. Any damage in them is shifted to your remaining health when they are removed, this can result in superficial converting to aggravated, and can cause you to keel over and die when the fighting ends.
- **Lifesaver**
  - _Flaw_: (●●●) **Lifesaver**: You refuse to kill under even the most significant or dire of circumstances or work directly with people who do. When you or your allies kill another human or partly human, permanently lose 1 point of Willpower until the end of the chronicle. The storyteller may rule that excessive torture or similar will count for this, too.
- **Love**
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Love**: There is someone you would do anything to protect. You must spend willpower points to roll Willpower (difficult = 3) to resist protecting or defending them via the most direct means possible.
- **Memory**
  - ●● **Eidetic Memory**: Your memory is picture perfect. You roll all memory checks at up to 3 depending on the visual element and may remember forgettable visual details.
- **Pain and Suffering**
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Masochist**: Take –1 to all rolls when you have no physical damage and +1 when you have half your health left (rounded up) or less.
  - _Flaw_: (●●) **Bloodthirsty**: You enjoy killing. Whenever you face the chance to kill someone, you must succeed on a Willpower (difficult = 2) roll not to.
- **Paradox Merits**
  - ●● **Paradox Magnet**: Whenever someone gains Paradox nearby, you may spend Willpower points to gain that many Paradox instead of the target. You may use this a maximum of once per story.
  - ●● **Paradoxical Dispersal**: Whenever you lose Paradox without Backlashing, you lose an extra point of paradox for each ten rolled.
  - ●●● **Blank Slate**: You are initially resistant to Paradox. Whenever you gain Paradox and are at 0 Paradox currently, you may spend a point of Willpower to reroll a die in your Paradox pool. You may not use or acquire this if you have any Permanent Paradox.
  - ●●● **Feel The Burn**: Whenever someone suffers Burn nearby, you may spend Willpower points to take that much Burn instead of the target. You may use this a maximum of once per story.
  - _Flaw_: (●●/●●●●●) **Permanent Paradox**: You’ve caused some severe backlash in the past, and you have 1 (2 dot flaw) or 2 (5 dot flaw) points of paradox that can never be removed for any reason.
  - _Flaw_: (●●) **Painful Paradox**: Regardless of the reason, the burn damage you cause due to backlash is always physical.
- **Phylactery**
  - _Flaw_: (●●●) **Phylactery**: Your avatar is trapped and sealed in an object for some reason. You may only cast spells when this object is on your immediate person.
- **Quickening**
  - ●●● **Quickening**: You can maintain one extra spell per penalty over normal before increasing your penalty.
- **Sight**
  - ●●● **Umbral Sight**: You instinctively recognize spirits from the Umbral. You gain an additional three to your dice pool when rolling to recognize spirits from the Umbra, and you may make awareness tests to pierce their veils and deceit even when you would typically require the Spirit sphere to do so.
- **Substance Use**
  - ● **High-Functioning Addict**: You add one die to any one category of a pool (specify when you choose which substance you use) when you use your drug.
- **Territorial**
  - ● **Stomping Ground**: You know your domain (no more than a half dozen city blocks) like the back of your hand. Roll one more die any time you roll for any test related to local knowledge.
  - ●●● **My City**: Cab drivers come to you for directions. In your domain (up to the size of a major city), you gain automatic success in addition to your roll anytime you roll for a test related to local knowledge.
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Insular**: You rarely leave your domain (no larger than a half dozen city blocks). Roll one less die anytime you roll for any test related to local knowledge.
- **Will**
  - ●●●●● **Iron Will**: When rolling Willpower tests, you do so ignoring superficial willpower damage.
  - _Flaw_: (●) **Weak Willed**: You permanently have a point of aggravated willpower damage that may not be removed under any circumstance.

### Backgrounds

- **Certification**: One of the above is chosen each time this background is bought.
  - **X** The usual stuff – driver’s license, government ID card, nothing special.
  - ● Hunting license, business license, passport to an open country, etc.
  - ●● Teaching certificate, bodywork license, PADI certification, CPA, trucker’s or motorcycle license, basic firearms permit, etc.
  - ●●● Concealed weapons permit, HAZMAT disposal license, church-ordained clergy, lifeguard certification, private investigator’s license, private pilot’s permit, etc.
  - ●●●● Class C weapons permit, board-certified medical or legal professional, professional aircraft pilot’s license, government intelligence operative, etc.
    - ●●●●● Diplomatic immunity, license to kill.
- **Demesne**: See more information on M20 page 311.
  - ● **Occasional Visitor**: You have a name for it and recognize a few significant features.
  - ●● **Regular Visitor**: You’ve traveled extensively through the Demesne.
  - ●●● **Well-known** **Place**: You know this place quite well in your dreams.
  - ●●●● **Your Realm**: This is your Realm, and though you don’t command its every feature or resident, they know and recognize you as someone of authority there.
  - ●●●●● **Ruler**: Lord or Lady of the Demesne, you know and command this Realm as if it were your kingdom… because it is.
- **Enhancement:** Enhancements can be purchased as Wonders; see M20, page 69, for details and page 657 for a list. Paradox Points are Permanent.
  - ●● +1 Attribute dot, or three wonder points for Devices. One Paradox point or Genetic Flaw.
  - ●●●● +2 Attribute dots, or six wonder points for Devices. Two Paradox points or Genetic Flaws.
  - ●●●●●● +3 Attribute dots, or nine wonder points for Devices. Three Paradox points or Genetic Flaws.
  - ●●●●●●●● +4 Attribute dots, or 12 wonder points for Devices. Four Paradox points or Genetic Flaws.
- **Familiar/Companion:** Animal allies are essential to mages. Known as familiars in most of the Nine Traditions, they also have various names in other groups.
Although the Technocracy officially ignores these, some Technocrats—particularly in the Progenitors and Iteration X—use Companions like cybernetic animals and bioengineered beings. Similarly, Void Engineers collaborate with modified creatures and aliens.
Despite their differences, Companions, and Familiars serve similar gameplay functions, primarily differing in bonding and care methods.
  - **Benefits**: This Background represents a character tied to the player but controlled by the Storyteller, offering several benefits:
    - **Advice**: The Familiar provides insights based on Skills like Occult and Investigation, with one die per dot in the Background.
    - **Empathy**: The mage and Companion can sense each other's emotions. Concealing feelings requires a Manipulation + Subterfuge roll.
    - **Paradox Mitigation**: The Familiar can absorb Paradox energy from the mage within 10 meters, holding up to three points for each dot in the Background. Exceeding this leads to a harmful backlash.
    - _Familiars also seek gifts and favors, with preferences that can vary greatly._
  - **Feeding**: The Familiar needs Quintessence or Tass every three days. A successful Familiar Check means they don’t need food that day; otherwise, they require 1 point. If unfed for a day, they disappear.
  - **Familiar/Companion:**
    - ● Your Companion has access to a few scattered bits of helpful information. (Requires one Familiar Check every three days and can absorb up to 3 points of Paradox.)
    - ●● You’ve got a pretty cool Companion. (Requires two Familiar Checks every three days and can absorb up to 6 points of Paradox.)
    - ●●● A magnificent Companion shares its wisdom and loyalty with you. (Three Familiar Checks every three days and up to 9 points of Paradox.)
    - ●●●● You’re favored with the presence (if not always the good behavior) of a smart and miraculous creature. (Four Familiar Checks every three days with up to 12 points of Paradox.)
    - ●●●●● Your Familiar probably knows more than you do, can be quite demanding, and has a very outspoken personality. (Five Familiar Checks every three days may retain up to 15 points of Paradox and will give you lots of shit about both.)
- **Safe House**
  - ● to ●●● **Occult Library**: You own or have access to a repository of arcane books and information. You may add the number of dots in this merit when rolling for an appropriate occult test, and you have access to your library.
  - ● **Nightclub/Coffee Shop/Pub**: Your haven is a great cover for meeting people, gossiping, soliciting information, private meeting rooms, and even staff. While they work for you, they will only help out as much as nightclub employees are meant to, and interfering too much with the day-to-day running of the club might cause problems.
- **Wonders** (Device, Fetish, Periapt, Talisman, Trinket or Biotech). See more details on M20.
  - ● A Wonder with one small power. (1-3 points)
  - ●● A Wonder with one or two powers, probably with some Quintessence and an Arete of its own. (4-6  points)
  - ●●● A Wonder with a few notable powers or one respectable one. (7-9 points)
  - ●●●● A Wonder with impressive powers or a powerful Effect. (10-12 points)
  - ●●●●● A Wonder with mighty powers or a single devastating Effect. (13-15 points)

## Scenario overview and adjustments proposal

### The Awakened World and the War

In the world, there are three major groups (sects with factions) of organized magickal operators:

- **The Nine Mystical Traditions (a.k.a. Traditions)**: The Traditions are formed by nine factions (traditions) with diverse beliefs and practices, but which collectively believe in the Ascension of humanity to a higher state (Ascension) through overcoming some essential aspect of consensual reality. There is no agreement on what Ascension is, but there is acceptance of a search for it individually and collectively. Initially, the Traditions sought a return to the days of High Magic or a new dawn of mystical potential. Still, today, they pursue the possibility of bringing the path of Ascension to all human beings through the means that each Tradition presents. In the past, many traditions already represented a significant threat to humanity in a world immersed in mysticism, where the sleepers had no security. And this shadow still haunts their lines.
- **The Technocratic Union (a.k.a. Technocracy)**: The Technocracy is formed by five factions (conventions) with unified core beliefs but diverse practices. They seek the protection of humanity by reinforcing a safe, consensual reality (without monsters and dangers) and a progression/evolution of humanity controlled by their enlightened agents (mages, even if not named as such). While the traditions want to overcome existing reality, the Technocracy wants to evolve reality through controlled enlightenment. Technocrats do not consider themselves mages and do not believe in magic; they understand themselves as enlightened scientists doing enlightened/advanced science. They initially emerged within a fundamentalist Christian religious vision and postures but quickly turned towards a rationalist worldview in the 18th century. They are the largest, most powerful, and organized group of awakened. However, they carry the weight of "who won but didn't take" from the so-called Ascension War, having significant responsibilities but less power than their antagonists imagine.
- **The Alliance of Disparate Crafts (Disparates)**: The Crafts/Disparates are factions of mages (or other understanding they have of their powers to change reality) that are not connected to previous factions. They may have been part of it at some point, like the case of the Ahl-i-Batin, who were part of the traditions in the past, but today, they are more concerned with protecting their customs, their local practices, and their people. They do not believe in the possibility of Ascension/Enlightenment of humanity, considering these lost causes. Some of these groups today gather under an Alliance, but without a greater joint belief, only mutual support for survival. They suffer from the fear that their disappearance is only a matter of time.

The three groups, as well as their factions, are occult organizations but not secret. There are precautions about openly disclosing the existence of the groups for fear of the general reaction of the sleepers and to avoid revealing strategies and resources to competing groups.

While the above groups start from positive ideals, such as Ascension, Enlightenment, or Preservation, there are two more sects worthy of note that reflect the consequences of doing magic.

- **Nephandi, or fallen**: They are the corrupted mages who seek personal and humanity's fall instead of Ascension. They do not believe in a positive outcome for humanity or themselves and seek the fall/destruction of everything. A small part of these are organized. Others are mages who have fallen through pride (hubris) and end up functioning as operators of this destruction (and sometimes are not fully aware of it).
- **Marauders, or insane**: They result from the extreme effects of Quiet. They are mentally isolated from consensual reality, living in parallel/own realities. However, they still affect the real world with their madness, being walking bombs of destruction of the fabric of reality.

These sects and factions have been fighting for over a millennium for the establishment, control, or overcoming of what reality is. Even though the Technocracy considered itself the winner of the Ascension War at the end of the 20th/beginning of the 21st century, nothing was as expected. It was a victory without a prize: Humanity continues to believe in many things (such as religions and mysticism, as well as conspiracy theories and pseudo-sciences) while at the same time seeming increasingly attached to the safe reality created by Technocracy, hindering even the enlightened evolution imagined by the organization.

After the defeat, Traditions and Disparates, previously stuck to their origins, understood that they needed to participate in the political game, significant changes, and corporations and that their role was not only for the awakened but all humanity.

> Both the Technocracy and the Traditions were created within a Eurocentric vision and supported colonialist actions and mentality. Only in the last 20 years have these groups been changing their positions and policies, both to expand their acceptance by other peoples and find more awakened people to compose their fronts, as well as an internal reaction from their non-European/Caucasian members wanting to be able to express their cultures and have access to adequate power and representation.

### Change in Original Atmosphere and Theme

The first three editions of Mage had a pessimistic and defeatist tone. The mystical Traditions struggled to survive against the apathetic and powerful Technocracy, ultimately being crushed in what was perceived as the world's end. The outliers tried to survive either in hiding or as part of the already wounded Traditions. The 20th Anniversary Edition introduces the setting with hope, depicting the Traditions finding ways to recover and the Technocracy realizing it had not won entirely.

However, despite the primarily positive adjustments made in M20, such as diversity, colonialism, and the effects of global capitalism, the lore still has loose ends regarding what motivates and differentiates the factions, how certain game elements impact the narrative (such as corruption/fall), and a somewhat unwieldy system that feels partially disconnected from the lore.

Additionally, Mage 20th Edition still primarily focuses on the Traditions. Although supplementary books (which are not new) cover the Technocracy and other groups, the focus remains on the Traditions if we aim for a more balanced, mixed, and morally gray game.

- **Theme: From Hope and Transformation (Mage 20th) to Power and Consequences**
  - Spiritual elevation, enlightenment, and Ascension remain vital for mages and their organizations, but the impact of actions is increasingly evident, revealing both culprits and accusers.
  - A more complex Ascension War demands different tactics from its participants, with higher stakes and ethical flexibilities once unthinkable.
- **Atmosphere: From Challenge and Reflection (Mage 20th) to Acceleration and Growing Anomie**
  - The world's end did not come, but collapse happened repeatedly, with each instance becoming more intense and frequent. The original Ascension War and the world's end took us a millennium and a half; the next endings will take far less time.
  - What was once true is now questioned. The sense of community/group needs to be more cohesive. There is a pervasive feeling of constant disorder, lack of structure, weak trust, and individualism as the solution to everything.

We are living more than ever in a battle for reality: a world of fake news, deepfakes, generative AIs producing videos, texts, and images, and the reinforcement of nationalist rhetoric, religious extremism, and cultural war. The Nephandi have never been so active, infiltrating every place (and faction) and whispering destruction, while the Marauders further accelerate the disintegration of reality by imposing their illusions. The truth is increasingly difficult to access and fragmented if it still exists.

In this battle, the Sleepers and their cultures and societies suffer. Even though the conflict is less open and warlike, with many interfaces, casual collaborations (especially against common threats), and tolerance, there is no war without collateral damage.

#### Key setting elements

Three key elements of the table's setting

1. **The Ascension War is more balanced, cold, and political**. The dispute over reality has never been so fierce, with a struggle for details and small gains, focusing on gathering influence in institutions, proxy battles, and many temporary unions, with the major factions rarely engaging in large open conflicts or confrontations that could put their ever-decreasing number of awakened at risk. Trying to convince members of another faction and the sleepers surrounding them to change sides is more the face of the moment. Enemies and allies are not clear figures, paving the way for many strange alliances that are more practical and effective than previous ties appeared.
2. **Known structures are changing, unraveling, and rebuilding**. How groups organize themselves is constantly evolving. Who commands, who obeys? There is intense conflict between the new and the old. The avatar storm/temporal anomaly, which occurred at the beginning of the 21st century, lost strength and fragmented into smaller storms, which move incoherently through the membrane between worlds. The technocracy and the traditions have lost their most potent realms and constructs, but some smaller ones have resisted and are taking up the space of power.
3. **Nephandi and Marauders are increasingly frequent problems for all other factions**. In an increasingly confusing reality, where consensual reality is in check in a new way (individualistic and histrionic x collective and narrative), there is much room for the fallen to accelerate their plans. Marauders are the face of this fragmented world centered on individuality and have emerged more frequently than in the past. And there is Nephandi infiltration on all sides. They are less powerful than many conspiracy theorists believe, but they are present in various forms and intensities in all power groups.

### Sects situation

#### Technocracy

At the beginning of the 21st century, the great victor of the late 20th century realized that it had won the war but that a new one was already emerging. In the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, the Technocracy recovered from a Nephandi infestation in its ranks after ignoring signs year after year to maintain control and follow the plan.

The advance of the Traditions and Disparates in institutions, in new modes in the struggle for reality, losing their anachronistic character in tactics and strategies, is also a novelty for a Technocracy already accustomed to acting against caricatured groups outdated in practices, tactics, and capabilities. However, the Technocratic Union remains strong, mainly commanding the world economy and its capitalist and neoliberal aspects. Still, today, it disputes spaces with traditionalists and disparates governments, institutions, and sleepers' hearts.

A world less centered on the definitions of the USA + Western Europe also forced the Technocracy to restructure itself beyond the aspects it was accustomed to focusing on. Within its lines, dissatisfaction with the Eurocentric and colonialist vision generated conflicts, breaks, and reformulations, with more scientific conventions, such as Progenitors, Iteration X, and Void Engineers increasingly disagreeing with the vision and actions of the Syndicate and the NWO, with more contours of personal gains and less collective ones. The Syndicate, formerly the gray eminence, has now taken the lead of the Union, leaving the supporting role to the NWO.

#### Traditions

After blows and their near destruction at the end of the 20th century, the traditions restructured themselves and learned new games. Initially with a rebel council, re-officialized after the avatar storm's end and the New Horizon's re-establishment as a fortress.

However, under new leadership, instead of fighting for the old ways, the traditions now advocate and fight for a diverse character of reality, a reality in which consensus is broader, more flexible, creative, and open. No,w also doing this within the sleeping institutional powers, they are no longer the madmen shouting in the middle of the street or teenagers invading government computers for digital vandalism (they still exist, but no longer as the dominant voice).

As part of the change, the Order of Hermes reluctantly ceded its self-proclaimed leadership position of the council for the Mercurial Elite (formerly known as the Virtual Adepts) to assume a role in leading the evolution and changes in the traditions. Changes in the Chakravanti, Kha'vadi, Akashayana, Verbenae, Celestial Chorus, and Sahajiya traditions also intensified and allowed for the alternation of power.

Like the Technocracy, the Traditions are also gaining more non-European contours, especially as a method of containing the advances of Crafts and the Disparate Alliance in places beyond the "West.”

#### The Disparates

After the organization of the Disparate Alliance in the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, the Crafts have also increasingly infiltrated the existing power structures to survive, especially in Western or global organizations, where their presence was previously meager.

Instead of hiding, the Crafts use their unique local knowledge, and their numbers are far from insignificant (considering that the Technocracy and Traditions lost many of their members at the end of the 20th century). But they still fight for their micro-realities and the possibility of maintaining their existence, especially beyond the safety of their localities.

Their tactic differs from the traditions in that they have a policy of non-interference in local interests. This policy allows for Ahl-i-Batin and Templars, Bata'as, and Ngomas within the Alliance without pretensions of unifying paradigms or intentions beyond survival.
